# RAAI Module Vehicle Output Writer

RAAI Component responsible for sending data to the Pikoder controlling the RC Car.

## Overview
The `Vehicle Output Writer` module integrates input from the Driver Input Reader and Control Panel modules, processes the data, and sends commands to the Pikoder to control the RC carâ€™s throttle, brake, clutch, and steering. It also optionally supports head tracking for additional control inputs.

## Data Flow
1. **Input**:
   - Driver input is received via `pynng` at:
     ```
     ipc:///tmp/RAAI/driver_input_reader.ipc
     ```
   - Configuration data is received from the Control Panel at:
     ```
     ipc:///tmp/RAAI/control_panel.ipc
     ```
2. **Processing**:
   - The module applies throttle, brake, clutch, and steering configurations defined in the `driver_output_config.json` file.
3. **Output**:
   - Commands are sent to the Pikoder via serial communication.
   - Processed data is published over:
     ```
     ipc:///tmp/RAAI/vehicle_output_writer.ipc
     ```

## Configuration
The module relies on a JSON configuration file (`driver_output_config.json`) to define serial ports and control parameters. If the file is missing, a default configuration is generated.

## Dependencies
- `pynng`
- `pyserial`
- Python 3.7+
